Orc Peon Tower Defense

# Notes




#OverallStory
Peon Orc notices that most everyone has left. He is told by the other orcs that they have left to raid an Elven village far to the North. Little did the Orcs know that the Elves has a spy amongst them and found out their plan. The idea was to get all the other creatures in the land to finally wipe out the orcs for good. The peon goes on guard duty and sees the Orc area getting attacked. He decides to defend with towers. After saving the place, he continues to the next area to defend, trying to rally the other Orcs that stayed behind. Unfortunately, most of the other Orcs are too stupid, lazy, or just plain donâ€™t like him. Only after getting attacked enough will the other Orcs listen to him. Eventually, the last of the orcs defend off the waves of baddies with mechanical wit and the will to eat all they kill.
